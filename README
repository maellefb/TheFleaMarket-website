I did not have the time to figure out how to set up a server, as I have been having mental health issues as well as being bed-ridden sick for a week, therefore missing the classes that where on this subject, and I simply don't have any more time to commit to this assignment as I have to study for my other classes. 
I did my best with the time and resources. 

The code does eveything that is asked for except for deploying, if you depoy it locally it will work. 

here is how you do it  from visual-studio-code
1. open a new terminal 
2. using the "cd" command move through your files to be able to acess the inside of my file directory
3. ex: cd assignment3_40231764
4.     cd Question4
5. once you are in the right directory go to the server.js file
6. if you already know what PORT is available on your computer then change the PORT with that one if not 
7. if not enter : netstat -aon or netstat -aon | findstr :5004
8. this will show you all the taken up port or will show you if the port that is currently connected is taken up. 
9. if there is no result then your good and you can use 5004
10. if not then enter:  taskkill /F /PID (pid number)
11. found: 
TCP    0.0.0.0:5004           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       17836
  TCP    [::]:5004              [::]:0                 LISTENING       17836

  after listening: 
12. ex: taskkill /F /PID 17836
13. once this is done go to the terminal where you should be in the directory that you nagivated to and enter. 
node server.js
14. this should give you a link to a local website where my website will be deployed.
